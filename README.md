## Introduction

Welcome to Flight Club, an online gliding simulator. The gliders look a bit like hang gliders. However, imagine them to be paragliders or sailplanes if you prefer; the same rules apply.


### Thermals

Cumulus clouds are fed by bubbles of warm rising air, called thermals. By using thermals, glider pilots are able to fly long distances. When you fly into a thermal you should circle to stay in the lift and climb upto cloud base.

Your vario will start beeping when you are in a thermal.


### Ridge Lift

Hills produce lift as the wind flows over them. A glider may ridge soar by flying back and forth in the rising air in front of the hill.

Glider pilots also like hills because they function as reliable thermal triggers.


### Your mission

Race against the other gliders; the finish line is 100km away to the north.

A note on navigation: To find the finish line, simply follow the road that runs north. You have a compass at the bottom right of the applet.


### Points of View

![Press <3> for the plan view](img/plan_b.gif)

Drag the mouse to rotate the camera position. You may switch between points of view using the number keys...

    <1> focus on your glider
    <2> watch the gaggle
    <3> the view from 5,000 meters above
    <4> the view from 8km away to the south east

Try pressing `<p>` to pause the action and then switch between the different points of view.

Dragging the mouse whilst the action is paused gives a cool 'bullet time' effect.

Flight Club - Coding Conventions
================================

For a general coding style guide, where better to look than the horses
mouth ? Unzip a few classes from the src.zip (see how_to.txt for some
tips on this). Look for some classes that interest you and study them
carefully. The author of this document finds Date.java, written by
James Gosling, a good read.

Code that is not well commented is probably not well thought out.

Here are some conventions used in Flight Club:

float[] p; // a point whose x, y and z co-ords are (p[0], p[1], p[2])
float[] _p; // the previous value of p
float[] p_; // the co-ords of p after applying a transformation, T
float[] dp; // a small change in p, say p(tN) - p(tN-1) where tN is
the time of the Nth frame and p(t) is the path of a particle
float[][] ps; // a list of points {{x0, y0, z0}, {x1, y1, z1}, ...}
float[] ps; // a flattened list of points {x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, ...}
